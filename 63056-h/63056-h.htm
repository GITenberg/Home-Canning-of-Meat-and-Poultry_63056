<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Follow all canning directions carefully. Processing times and temperatures
were developed specifically for use with a pressure canner.</p>
<p>Meat may contain bacteria that cause botulism, a severe form of food
poisoning. These bacteria are destroyed when cans or jars of food are
processed at a temperature of 240&deg; F. for the times specified.</p>
<p>There is a risk of botulism from home-canned meats if the processing
temperature is lower than 240&deg; F. or if processing time is shorter than
recommended.</p>
<p>It is not safe to process canned meat in a boiling-water bath, an oven, a
steamer without pressure, or an open kettle. None of these methods will
heat the meat enough to kill dangerous bacteria in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>There also is a risk of botulism if shortcuts are taken in canning meats, if
untested directions are used, or if processing times (pp. <a class="htm" href="#Page_18">18</a> to <a class="htm" href="#Page_23">23</a>) are changed.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Getting Ready</span></h2>
<h3 id="c2">Meats</h3>
<p>Use only good-quality meat or poultry&mdash;home-produced or purchased from
a farm or store.</p>
<p>Chill home-produced meat immediately after slaughter to prevent spoiling
and to permit tenderizing. Meat is easier to handle when it is cold. For
thorough chilling, keep meat at a temperature below 40&deg; F. until time to
prepare it for canning; can it within a few days after slaughter.</p>
<p>If refrigeration is not available and if the maximum daily temperature is
above 40&deg; F., process the meat as soon as body heat is gone.</p>
<p>If meat must be held for longer than a few days, freeze it. Store frozen
meat at temperatures of 0&deg; F. or lower until canning time. Then cut or saw
frozen meat into pieces of desired size.</p>
<p>If frozen meat is thawed before canning, thaw it in a refrigerator at a
temperature of 40&deg; F. or lower until most of the ice crystals have disappeared.</p>
<p>Keep all meat clean and sanitary. Rinse poultry thoroughly in cold
water, then drain.</p>
<p>Keep all meat as cool as possible during preparation for canning. Handle
it rapidly; process it as soon as containers are packed.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Equipment</h3>
<p>To control the bacteria that cause spoilage, keep everything that touches
meat as clean as possible.</p>
<p>Scrub metal, enamelware, and porcelain pans in hot soapy water. Rinse
pans well in boiling water before putting meat in them. Wash knives and
kitchen tools to be used in canning; rinse well with boiling water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Cutting boards, wood utensils, and wooden work surfaces need special
treatment to keep spoilage bacteria under control. Scrape surfaces if necessary;
scrub with hot soapy water and rinse well with boiling water. Then
disinfect clean surfaces.</p>
<p>For disinfecting, use a liquid chlorine disinfectant (household laundry
bleach) or other disinfectant. Dilute according to directions on the container.
Cover wooden surfaces with the disinfectant solution and leave 15 minutes.
Wash solution off with boiling water.</p>
<h4>Pressure canner</h4>
<p>To insure the safety of canned meats and poultry, jars or cans must be
processed at a sufficiently high temperature for a long enough time to kill
all bacteria that cause spoilage or food poisoning.</p>
<p>The only practical way to get this high temperature is to use a pressure
canner. When steam is held under 10 pounds of pressure at sea level, the
temperature in the canner quickly reaches 240&deg; F.&mdash;the necessary safe temperature
for canning meat.</p>
<p>A pressure canner should be equipped with a rack to hold jars or cans.</p>
<p>A pressure saucepan with accurate controls may be safely used for processing
meats in pint jars or No. 2 cans. If you use a pressure saucepan, add
20 minutes to the processing times specified.</p>
<p>Before using the canner, wash the kettle well. Do not put cover with dial
gage in water. Wipe the cover carefully with a hot soapy cloth; repeat with
a clean damp cloth. Dry. Keep the petcock and safety valve clear. Before
each use of the canner, inspect these openings. To clean, draw a string or
narrow strip of cloth through the petcock.</p>
<p><i>Pressure adjustments.</i>&mdash;If you live above sea level, you may need to adjust
steam pressure in your canner to get a temperature of 240&deg; F. The rule:
For each 2,000 feet above sea level, increase the pressure by 1 pound.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Caution:</span> Do not increase processing time when you increase steam
pressure.</p>
<p>If a weighted gage is used at a high altitude, have it corrected for altitude
by the manufacturer of the canner.</p>
<p><i>Gage adjustments.</i>&mdash;When a weighted gage is adjusted for altitude, it
needs no further regulation.</p>
<p>A dial gage should be checked before the canning season. If you use the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
canner frequently, have the gage checked several times a year. Ask your
extension home economist, your dealer, or the manufacturer about checking
the accuracy of a dial gage.</p>
<p>If the dial gage is not accurate, tie a warning tag to the canner. On the
tag, write the margin of error, the date the canner was tested, and the gage
setting to use for the correct pressure (see below).</p>
<p>All directions in this bulletin require processing at 10 pounds of steam
pressure. The following adjustments give the correct pressure:</p>
<p>If the gage reads high&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1 pound high&mdash;process at 11 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">2 pounds high&mdash;process at 12 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">3 pounds high&mdash;process at 13 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">4 pounds high&mdash;process at 14 pounds.</p>
</div>
<p>If the gage reads low&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1 pound low&mdash;process at 9 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">2 pounds low&mdash;process at 8 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">3 pounds low&mdash;process at 7 pounds.</p>
<p class="t0">4 pounds low&mdash;process at 6 pounds.</p>
</div>
<p>It is not safe to use a canner if the dial gage registers as much as 5 pounds
high or low. Replace a faulty gage with an accurate one.</p>
<h4>Glass jars</h4>
<p>Jars may be widemouth or regular type. Pints and quarts are satisfactory
sizes for canning meats and poultry.</p>
<p>There are two types of jar closures:</p>
<ul><li>Flat metal lid with sealing compound and a metal screw band. This closure seals as jar cools.</li>
<li>Porcelain-lined zinc cap with a shoulder rubber ring. This cap must be tightened to complete the seal immediately after meat is canned.</li></ul>
<p>Be sure all jars and closures are perfect. Discard jars with cracks or chips;
discard lids and bands with dents or rust. Defects prevent air-tight seals.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="{jar and lid}" width="800" height="338" />
</div>

<dd>Metal lid with sealing compound</dd>
<dd>Seals here</dd>
<dt>Porcelain lined screw cap</dt>
<dd>Rubber</dd>
<dd>Seals here</dd></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Before canning, jars must be thoroughly clean. It is not necessary to
sterilize them before they are filled, however. Processing at the recommended
steam pressure sterilizes both the containers and their contents.</p>
<p>Wash jars and lids in hot soapy water; rinse well. Some metal lids with
sealing compound may need boiling or holding in boiling water for a few
minutes before use. Do not reuse metal lids with sealing compounds.
Follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions.</p>
<p>If you use rubber rings, get new ones of the right size to fit jars. Don&rsquo;t
test by stretching. Wash rings in hot soapy water. Rinse well.</p>
<h4>Tin cans</h4>
<p>Use plain tin cans in good condition for canning meats.</p>
<p>C-enamel, R-enamel, and sanitary-enamel cans are not suitable for meat.
Fat in meat or poultry may cause enamel to peel off the inside of the can.
Meat in such cans appears unappetizing, but it is not harmful.</p>
<p>Make sure that cans, lids, and gaskets are perfect. Discard cans that are
badly bent, dented, or rusty; discard lids with damaged gaskets.</p>
<p>Protect lids from dirt and moisture by storing them in original packing.</p>
<p>Directions are given for canning meat in No. 2 and No. 2&frac12; tin cans. A
No. 2 can holds 2&frac12; cups; a No. 2&frac12; can holds 3&frac12; cups.</p>
<p>Wash cans in clean hot water just before use. Drain upside down.</p>
<p>Do not wash lids of cans, because washing may damage the gaskets. If
lids have become soiled, rinse with clean water or wipe with a damp cloth when
you are ready to put them on cans.</p>
<h4>Sealer</h4>
<p>If you use cans, you need a sealer in good working order. Before processing
meat or poultry, adjust sealer according to manufacturer&rsquo;s directions.</p>
<p>The finished seam between lid and can should be smooth and even.</p>
<p>Test by sealing a can containing a small amount of water. Submerge the
sealed can in boiling water for a few seconds. If air bubbles rise from around
the can, the seam is not tight. Readjust the sealer.</p>
<h4>Thermometer</h4>
<p>It is a good idea to use a thermometer both when meat is packed hot and
when the canning directions call for removing (exhausting) air from jars or
cans. With a thermometer, you are able to make sure meat is heated to
170&deg; F.&mdash;the minimum temperature needed to exhaust air properly.</p>
<p>Place thermometer in center of jar or can that is being heated. The thermometer
bulb should be about half-way to the bottom of the container.</p>
<p>If a thermometer is not available, follow the times given in the directions.</p>

<h3>How To Make Broth</h3>
<p>To make meat or poultry broth, place bony pieces in saucepan and cover
with cold water. Simmer until meat is tender. Pour broth into another
pan; skim off fat. Add boiling broth to containers packed with precooked
meat or poultry; fill to level specified in directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c5">Packing</h3>
<p>Pack meat loosely in containers. Jars may lose liquid during processing
if they are packed too tightly or too full.</p>
<p>Work with one glass jar or tin can at a time. Keep precooked meat hot
while packing. Use boiling liquid&mdash;broth, meat juice, or water&mdash;if directions
call for added liquid.</p>
<p>Two methods are used for packing meat:</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; <i>Hot pack.</i> Meat is precooked before it is packed in jars or cans.
Boiling broth or boiling water is poured over meat before containers
are processed in a pressure canner. (See <a class="htm" href="#Page_8">p.&nbsp;8</a> for directions on how
to make broth.) The temperature of food packed hot should be at
least 170&deg; F. at the time jars are closed or cans are sealed.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; <i>Raw pack.</i> Meat is packed uncooked. Raw-packed meat usually is
heated to 170&deg; F. to exhaust&mdash;or remove&mdash;air from jars or cans before
processing in a pressure canner.</p>
<p>Directions for canning in glass jars require exhausting air from raw-packed
meat products, except meat-vegetable stew and raw pack poultry, with bone.
These two products may be processed without exhausting if they are raw
packed in glass jars according to directions on pages <a class="htm" href="#Page_20">20</a> and <a class="htm" href="#Page_22">22</a>.</p>
<p>Directions for using tin cans include exhausting air from all raw-packed
meat. It always is necessary to exhaust air from raw-packed meat in tin
cans before processing because air has no way to escape after cans are sealed.</p>
<h4>Exhausting air</h4>
<p>To exhaust&mdash;or remove&mdash;air, set open jars or cans packed with raw meat on
a rack in a large pan of boiling water. Water level should be about 2 inches
below tops of jars or cans. Cover the pan. Cook meat in containers at slow
boil until temperature at center of jars or cans registers 170&deg; F. If a thermometer
is not available, follow times given to cook meat until medium done.</p>
<p>When raw-packed meat is heated to 170&deg; F., air is driven out of the food so
that a vacuum will be formed in jars or cans after processing and cooling.
Exhausting air also helps to prevent changes in the flavor of canned meat.</p>
<h4>Salt</h4>
<p>Salt may be added to canned meat for flavor. It does not act as a preservative
in canned meat, so it is not needed to make the product safe.</p>
<p>If you decide to use salt, add it after meat is packed in the jar or can.
Amounts for various sized containers are given in the canning directions.</p>
<h4>Fat</h4>
<p>Remove as much fat as possible from meat before canning. Cut off all
large lumps; trim marbled meat without slashing the lean unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Do not use excessively fat meat or poultry for canning.</p>
<p>After packing containers, wipe the tops free of fat. Any fat that gets on
the rim of jars or cans may prevent an airtight seal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c6">Closing Jars</h3>
<p>If jar has a flat metal lid: Wipe rim of packed jar to remove fat and meat
particles that might prevent a proper seal. Put lid on jar with sealing
compound next to glass. Screw the metal hand down tight by hand. When
band is screwed tight, this lid has enough &ldquo;give&rdquo; to let air escape during
processing. Do not tighten band further after taking jar from canner.</p>
<p>If jar has a porcelain-lined zinc lid: Fit wet rubber ring down on shoulder
of empty jar. Don&rsquo;t stretch ring unnecessarily. Pack jar with meat.
Wipe rubber ring and jar rim clean. Then screw cap down firmly and turn
it back &frac14; inch before processing. As soon as you take jar from canner,
screw cap down tight to complete seal.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Sealing Cans</h3>
<p>Use a can sealer in good working condition. Follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s
directions carefully.</p>
<p>Wipe rim clean; place lid on can. Seal at once.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="632" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="jri">PN-1327</span>
<br />A can sealer is needed if tin cans are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c8">Processing</h3>
<p>Use a pressure canner for processing meat. A pressure saucepan may be
used for pint jars or No. 2 cans (see <a class="htm" href="#Page_5">p.&nbsp;5</a>).</p>
<p>Follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions carefully. Here are a few suggestions
about using a pressure canner:</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Put 2 or 3 inches of water in the canner; heat to boiling. Use enough
water to prevent the canner from boiling dry.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Set packed jars or cans on rack in the canner. Allow space for steam
to flow around each container. If there are two layers of cans or
jars, stagger the top layer. Use a rack between layers of jars.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Fasten canner cover securely so that all steam escapes through the
petcock or weighted-gage opening.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Let steam pour steadily from vent for 10 minutes to drive all air from
the canner. Then close petcock or put on weighted gage.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Let pressure rise to 10 pounds (240&deg; F.). The moment this pressure
is reached, start to count processing time. Regulate heat under the
canner to maintain even pressure. Do not lower pressure by opening
petcock. Keep drafts from blowing on canner. Fluctuating
pressure during processing causes liquid to be drawn out of glass jars.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; Watch processing time carefully. When time is up, remove canner
from heat immediately.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; If meat is packed in jars, let canner stand until pressure drops to zero.
Do not pour cold water over canner. When pressure is reduced suddenly,
jars lose liquid. After pressure registers zero, wait a minute or
two. Then slowly open petcock or take off weighted gage. Unfasten
cover and tilt the far side up so steam escapes away from you. Take
jars from the canner.</p>
<p class="revint">&#149; If meat is packed in cans, remove canner from heat as soon as processing
time is up. Open petcock or take off weighted gage at once to
release steam. Then unfasten cover, tilting far side up so steam
escapes away from your face. Remove cans.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Yield of Canned Meat From Fresh</h3>
<p>The number of jars or cans you get from a given amount of raw meat
varies with the size of the pieces and the way the meat is packed.</p>
<p>For a 1-quart jar, allow approximately the following amounts of fresh,
untrimmed meat with bone or ready-to-cook chicken:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td colspan="2" class="lx">Beef: </td><td class="c"><i>Pounds</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="lx"> </td><td class="l">Round </td><td class="c">3 to 3&frac12;.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lx"> </td><td class="l">Rump </td><td class="c">5 to 5&frac12;.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" class="lx">Pork loin </td><td class="c">5 to 5&frac12;.</td></tr>

</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">After-Canning Jobs</span></h2>
<h3 id="c11">Cooling</h3>
<h4>Glass jars</h4>
<p>As soon as you take jars out of the canner, complete seals if necessary.</p>
<p>Cool jars top side up. Put them on a rack or folded cloth to cool. Keep
them away from drafts. Don&rsquo;t cover.</p>
<p>When jars are cool, take off screw bands. Do not force bands that stick:
loosen by covering them with a hot damp cloth. Wash hands and store
them in a dry place.</p>
<h4>Tin cans</h4>
<p>As soon as you take cans out of the canner, put them in cold water.
Change water frequently for fast cooling. Remove cans from water while
they are still warm so they will dry in the air. If you stack cans, stagger
them to allow air circulation.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Checking Seals</h3>
<p>Check containers for leaks when jars or cans are thoroughly cool.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a can packed too full bulges at the ends. Set it aside and
use within a few days. This will prevent later confusion with cans that
bulge from spoilage during storage.</p>
<p>On the day after canning, examine each jar carefully. Turn it partially
over. If jar has a flat metal lid, test seal by tapping center of lid with a
spoon. A clear ring means a good seal. A dull note, however, does not
always mean a poor seal. Another test is to press on the center of the lid;
jar is sealed if lid is down and does not move.</p>
<p>Examine seams and seals carefully on all cans. Can ends should be almost
flat, with a slight inward curve. Buckled or broken seams may be caused
by cooling cans too fast or by not filling cans with enough meat.</p>
<p>Do not store leaky jars and cans. Either use the food at once or can it again
in another container. Begin the second canning by heating meat through.
Then pack and process it in a pressure canner for the full time recommended.</p>
<p>Do not open and refill jars that have lost liquid during processing. Loss
of liquid does not cause canned meat to spoil. Opening would contaminate
the sterile contents, and meat would have to be processed again to insure
safety.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Labeling</h3>
<p>Wipe containers after they are cool. Label each jar and can to show contents
and date of canning. If you canned more than one lot on one day, add
a lot number.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c14">Storing</h3>
<p>Select a cool, dry place for storing canned meat and poultry. Protect
meat from heat, from freezing, and from dampness.</p>
<p>Heat causes canned foods to lose quality. Do not store canned meats
in direct sunlight, near hot pipes, or near heat.</p>
<p>Freezing does not cause canned meat to spoil, but it may damage the
seal so that spoilage begins. In an unheated storage area, cover jars and
cans with a clean, old blanket or wrap them in newspapers.</p>
<p>Dampness may corrode cans or metal jar lids and cause leakage.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Spoilage</span></h2>
<p>Immediately destroy any canned meat that has spoiled. Burn it or dispose
of it where it cannot be eaten by humans or animals.</p>
<p>Do not taste canned meat that you suspect of being spoiled.</p>
<p>Take these positive steps to insure the safety of canned meat&mdash;</p>
<ul><li>Keep meat and equipment clean.</li>
<li>Follow recommended methods, including processing times and temperatures.</li>
<li>Cool and store properly.</li></ul>
<p>To avoid any risk of botulism&mdash;a serious food poisoning&mdash;it is essential that
the pressure canner be in perfect order and that every canning recommendation
be followed exactly. Unless you are absolutely sure of your gage and
canning methods, boil home-canned meat 20 minutes in a covered pan before
tasting or using.</p>
<p>Boiling is the best way to find out if canned meat is safe. Heat brings
out the characteristic odor of spoiled meat. If meat develops such an odor,
destroy it without tasting.</p>
<p>If boiled meat is not to be used at once, or if it is to be used in salads or
sandwiches, refrigerate it immediately.</p>
<p>Be alert to signs of spoilage when you take meat containers from storage.
Bulging jar lids or rings, gas bubbles, leaks, bulging can ends&mdash;these may
mean the seal has broken and the food has spoiled. Test each can by
pressing the ends; ends should not bulge or snap back.</p>
<p>Check the contents as you open the container. Spurting liquid, off-odor,
and color changes in meats are danger signals.</p>
<p>Sulfur in meat often causes metal lids or cans to darken. This discoloration
does not affect the safety of the meat.</p>

<p>Directions for canning cut-up meat
may be used for beef, veal, pork,

animals may be canned by the
same directions.</p>
<p>Use tender meat&mdash;loin and cuts
suitable for roasts, steaks, and chops&mdash;for
canning as large pieces. Use
less tender cuts that contain more
connective tissue and small pieces for
canning as stew meat or ground meat.
Use bony pieces for soup.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Cut-Up Meat</h3>
<p>Follow directions for cutting up
meat (<a class="htm" href="#Page_14">p.&nbsp;14</a>).</p>
<p>Cut tender meat into jar- or can-length
strips. Strips should slide
into jars or cans easily, with the grain
of the meat running the length of the
container. Strips may be any convenient
thickness, from 1 or 2 inches
to jar or can width.</p>
<p>Cut less tender meat into chunks or
small pieces suitable for stew meat.</p>
<p>Small, tender pieces may be packed
by themselves, with meat strips, or
with stew meat.</p>
<h4>Hot pack</h4>

<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">Questions and Answers</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Why must a pressure canner be used for canning meat and poultry?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. To insure a safe product. It takes a combination of high temperature and
sufficient processing time to make sure of killing bacteria that cause dangerous
spoilage in canned meat and poultry. The only practical way to get
the necessary high temperature is to use a pressure canner.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. How should meat and poultry for canning be handled?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Keep meat and poultry clean and sanitary. Chill at once and keep cold
until canning time. (See <a class="htm" href="#Page_4">p.&nbsp;4</a>.)</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Why is liquid sometimes lost from glass jars during processing?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Loss of liquid may be due to packing jars too full, fluctuating pressure in
a pressure canner, or lowering pressure too suddenly.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Should liquid lost during processing be replaced?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Loss of liquid does not cause meat to spoil, although the meat above
the liquid may darken. Never open a jar and refill with liquid&mdash;this would
let in bacteria and meat would have to be processed again.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Is it safe to can meat and poultry without salt?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Yes. Salt is used for flavor only and is not necessary for safe processing.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Is it safe to leave food in tin cans after opening?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Yes. Food in tin cans needs only to be covered and refrigerated.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Is it all right to use preservatives in home canning?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. No. Some canning powders or other chemical preservatives may be
harmful.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Should processing times be changed for different types of ranges?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. No. Processing times and temperatures given in this bulletin are for canning
in a pressure canner and may be used for any type of range.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="ss">Q. Is it possible to can frozen meat or poultry?</span></p>
<p class="revint">A. Yes, frozen meat or poultry may be canned. (For directions, see <a class="htm" href="#Page_4">p.&nbsp;4</a>.)</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
